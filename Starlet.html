Martin Odegaar returned to the starting 11 in the competition for the first time following a new two-month absence and shone for Arsenal in their thumping win at Sporting.
Martin Keown was full of confidence for the playmaker,who he believed has helped saka become a better player.
"They're building,aren'they?And they're certainly building their reputation,"the former Gunners defender told TNT Sport.<br>
"We talked about belief,and there were aoccasion  this season when you thought the world was against them a little bit,but they've kept thet belief.<br>
"I think Odegaard is a player who has come in and really opened up that creative channel for Saka,and those two in tandem are as good as anything in Europe,on that right-handside of the  pitch.<br>
"Long may it continue,it's one performance and one result,but they've got to take that forward nom.Tonight will be a tremendous boost for their confidence.<br>

<h2>Suspected serial killer confesses to murdering 10-year-old girl</h2><br>
By Cyrus Sholim Published on: November 11, 2024 05:05 (EAT)<br>
<p>
Evans Juma Wanjala, the suspect in the killing of five minors in the Mois Bridge area,<br>
Uasin Gishu County in 2021, has confessed to murdering one of his victims.Wanjala appeared <br>
before the Eldoret High Court on Monday, where he confessed to killing 10-year-old Stacy Nabiso.<br>
The suspect sought a plea-bargaining deal with the prosecution.Justice Reuben Nyakundi granted <br>
Wanjala’s application to explore a plea bargain agreement and adjourned the matter for two weeks<br> 
to enable consultation between the defence and prosecution.<br>
<br>
Nabiso went missing on December 31, 2019, and her body was found in the Soweto estate on January 1, 2020.<br> 
The court had ordered the exhumation of her remains before a post-mortem exercise was conducted.<br>
The five minors had been found murdered and their bodies dumped or buried in separate areas<br>
within Moi’s Bridge township.The Court heard that DNA analysis showed that samples collected <br>
from the minor’s t-shirt and underwear matched with those taken from Wanjala.Wanjala is said<br>
to have also murdered Linda Cherono, 13, Mary Elusa, 14, Grace Njeri, 12 and Lucy Wanjiru, 15,<br>
 after defiling them.The case is scheduled for a mention and status conference on November 28, 2024<br>

<h2>Garissa Woman Rep Udgoon wants Senator Haji probed over alleged incitement</h2><br>
By Citizen Reporter Published on: November 11, 2024 06:00 <br>

<p>
Garissa Woman Representative Edo Udgoon has written to the National Cohesion and Integration Commission<br>
(NCIC) calling for a probe into the county’s senator, Abdul Haji, whom she accuses of incitement.<br>
Udgoon refers to a social media video of the senator, which she claims was recorded on November 9 <br>
as Haji was addressing a rally in the Garissa township.The video appears show Senator Haji saying:<br>
“Kila wakati tunakaa na amani lakini mara kwa mara tunachokozwa na watu wengine. llikuwa kama familia<br>
ya Samawathal tulipata msiba wakati vijana wetu wanne walipigwa risasi kinyama... wasita… walipigwa risasi kinyama.”<br>
“Sisi tukakasirika, wamama wakalia na wakati ile nakumbuka tukiwaeleza Samawathal tukuwe na subra… <br>
leo wamama yetu wanalia lakini inshallah siku karibu wamama wengine ya watu wengine ya watu ndio watalia…”<br>
<br>
This translates to: “We have mostly lived peacefully but occasionally other people provoke us.<br>
As Samawathal’s family, four… six of our young family members were shot dead mercilessly."“We were outraged, <br>
mothers cried and we told Samawathal to be patient; today it is our mothers crying but soon, God-willing, <br>
other people’s mothers are the ones who will be crying.”<br>
<br>
In a November 11, letter to the NCIC CEO, Udgoon says the senator’s comments<br> 
“are well intended to incite violence and hatred against members of a certain community,<br>
and have the potential to exacerbate tensions between different ethnic groups in Garissa County<br> 
and sparked fear of ethnic tensions.Further, the woman representative says the senator has gone <br>
afoul of the conduct of a leader or state officer per the Constitution,<br>
to hold Senator Abdul Mohammed Haji accountable for his irrational averments in order to<br>
safeguard the precious lives of the people of Garissa County,” writes Udgoon.<br>
She has also copied the Interior Ministry, Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and<br>
the Directorate of Criminal Investigations in the letter.<br>

 Breaking the banking barriers with Absa's Julia Shisia</h2><br>
By Claire Munde Published on: November 12, 2024 01:57 (EAT)<br>
<br>
<p>
When it comes to taking calculated risks, Julia Shisia knows a thing or two about it.<br>
From building a career in banking at a well-known institution to taking a step back<br>
to a little-known institution to focus on motherhood, Julia took a risk that finally paid off<br>
and today, she has a seat at the table as the executive director of the top<br>
bancassurance intermediary in Kenya.Julia speaks about the importance of being a skilled negotiator,<br> 
especially as a woman seeking to rise up to the C-Suite.<br>
This week on She Means Business, we talk to Julia about crushing the glass ceiling<br> 
in the male-dominated banking field, why she doesn’t believe there is such a thing as work-life balance,<br>
 and what financial decisions have shaped her life.<br>

<h2>Malindi residents in court to block possible takeover of KAA assets by Adani</h2>
By Rob Liban Published on: November 12, 2024 03:06 (EAT)<br>
<p>
More than 198 residents of Kwachocha area in Malindi are now seeking immediate compensation<br>
for their land acquired by the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) to expand the Malindi International Airport.<br>
of a possible Adani takeover of KAA assets until they are compensated for their land.<br>
Through their advocate Vincent Mogaka, the applicants fear that if the takeover that is expected anytime<br>
next month happens at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in Nairobi then all assets of KAA<br> 
countrywide may be affected and they might miss out on compensation from the authority.<br>
<br>
In an earlier notice of motion dated October 8, 2024, the 198 applicants said that the compensation<br>
had dragged on for more than 15 years hence they feared that once Adani took over operations,<br>
they risk losing the compensation money.Justice Mwangi Njoroge of the Environment and Lands court in Malindi<br>
said he will rule on the matter on December 3, 2024.The KAA lawyer Adhoch Emeli however opposed the application <br>
saying that his client would only relinquish JKIA to Adani group.<br>
